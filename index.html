		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hey, I'm Jack. I've been interested in computers since the very beginning, having used a Mac for about 2/3 of my life. Lately I've become passionate about discovering ways to keep human-computer interaction as intuitive as possible, and I imagine that's what my future career will be centered on.</p>
		<p>When it comes to experience, I'm a competent Sketch user and a beginner in Figma. HTML is completely new to me, as you can tell by the state of this website. Git is also new to me. I'm only 16 though, so I have *counts quietly* uh, a long time to learn about those.</p>
		<h2>See what I'm up to</h2>
		<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JackHinkle32/">Link</a> to my Twitter page, @JackHinkle32<br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JackHinkle/">Link</a> to my Reddit page, u/JackHinkle</p>
		<p>The hosting service I'm using is actually just my email provider, so I can't update this page willy-nilly whenever I want. If you want a live and completely up-to-date feed of what I'm doing, I'd recommend checking out my Twitter page, @JackHinkle32 <a href="https://twitter.com/JackHinkle32/">(here)</a></p>
		<p>I'm also on Reddit, but I usually don't do much on there other than post memes and leave random comments. I'm u/JackHinkle, and here's the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JackHinkle/">link.</a> Don't follow me on Reddit. That's weird.</p>
		<h2>Contact me</h2>
		<p>If you need to contact me for non-professional reasons, please just DM me through Twitter (or Reddit, if you're weird like that.) If you need to contact me for professional reasons, you can use the email address listed below.</p>
