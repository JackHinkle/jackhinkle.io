		<h1>Hey, I'm Jack.</h1>
		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>I'm a 16-year-old hobbyist designer and newbie developer.</p>
		<p>I've had a lifelong interest in computers and technology, which was sparked by my first use of the family iMac. I've been Mac-exclusive since then.</p>
		<p>I strongly believe that today's user interfaces do not allow the user to utilize the full potential of today's technology. If we want humans of the future to coexist with technology, we must get clear and intuitive interfaces established first.</p>
