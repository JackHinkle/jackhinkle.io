		<h1>Hey, I'm Jack.</h1>
		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>I'm a 16 y/o hobbyist designer and "developer."</p>
		<p>I've had a lifelong interest in computers and technology, which is something I'm confident traces back to my first experience with the family iMac.</p>
		<p>I'd really like to expand on what I've done throughout my life, but the list is so large that it warrants an entire page of its own. I'll have to get to that someday.</p>
