Source code of my website.

I had to learn both HTML and CSS for this site specifically. Because every site's HTML and CSS code is out to the public (for the most part), I used several sites to help guide me along. Here's that list:

- apple.com
- charliechao.com
- highcaffeinecontent.com
- skribbl.io
